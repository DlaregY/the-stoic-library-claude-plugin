# The Stoic Library

Search the Stoic classics by topic or look up a passage by reference. Retrieve exact excerpts, named translations, whole letters and chapters, and surrounding context. Follow edition-specific links to read more in The Stoic Library. Search results are candidates for your assistant to evaluate; the tools do not generate philosophical advice or authenticate quotations absent from the indexed corpus.

This plugin bundles one remote MCP connector and one skill. The connector points to `https://thestoiclibrary.com/mcp`, a public, read-only, no-authentication endpoint operated by Gerald Norby. It exposes two tools: one searches the library's public-domain Stoic translations for candidate passages, and one retrieves exact text, edition metadata, surrounding sections and reading links. The skill tells Claude when to use those tools and how to quote, attribute and paginate their results.

## What the plugin sends and receives

When Claude calls a tool, it sends the endpoint short search terms or a passage reference, optional author, work and edition filters, and pagination or context settings. The endpoint returns public source text and metadata. It makes no calls to an AI provider, requires no account, and does not write tool inputs or results to an application log or database. Leave personal details out of queries. The plugin contains no executable code, hooks or local servers.
